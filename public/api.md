## Quick Start

### Python SDK
```python
from memory_agent import MemoryAgent

# Initialize
agent = MemoryAgent()

# Set context
agent.set_context(location="Tokyo, Japan", activity="vacation")

# Store memory with grounding
memory_id = agent.store_memory("The food here is amazing")

# Search memories
memories = agent.search_memories("food in Tokyo")

# Ask questions
response = agent.answer_question("What did you think of Tokyo food?")
```

### REST API
```bash
# Base URL: http://localhost:5001

# Store a memory
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/remember \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"memory": "The food here is amazing", "apply_grounding": true}'

# Search memories

## Context System

The Memory Agent includes a sophisticated contextual grounding system that automatically resolves relative references in memories.

### Context Categories

#### Temporal References
- "today", "yesterday", "last week"
- "this morning", "earlier"
- "now", "currently"

#### Spatial References
- "here", "there", "this place"
- "nearby", "around here"
- "upstairs", "downstairs"

#### Personal References
- "he", "she", "they"
- "my friend", "the guy"
- "everyone", "someone"

#### Environmental References
- "this weather", "it's hot"
- "the atmosphere", "the vibe"
- "the situation"

#### Demonstrative References
- "this", "that", "these", "those"
- "the one", "the thing"

### Context Resolution Examples

```python
# Set context
agent.set_context(
    location="Tokyo, Japan",
    activity="vacation",
    people_present=["Sarah", "Mike"],
    weather="rainy"
)

# Store memory with relative references
agent.store_memory("It's really wet outside today")
# Resolves to: "The weather in Tokyo, Japan is very rainy today (2024-01-15)"

agent.store_memory("Sarah and Mike loved this place")
# Resolves to: "Sarah and Mike loved Tokyo, Japan"

agent.store_memory("We should come back here next year")
# Resolves to: "We should come back to Tokyo, Japan next year"
```

### Context Persistence
- Context persists across memory operations
- Update context as your situation changes
- Context snapshots are stored with each memory
- Historical context is preserved for each memory

---

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Operations
```python
# Store multiple memories with context
agent.set_context(location="Conference Center", activity="tech conference")

memories = [
    "The keynote speaker was excellent",
    "Learned about new AI frameworks",
    "Met interesting people from startups",
    "The networking lunch was valuable"
]

memory_ids = []
for memory in memories:
    memory_id = agent.store_memory(memory)
    memory_ids.append(memory_id)
```

### Custom Context Tracking
```python
# Track complex environmental context
agent.set_context(
    location="Home Office",
    activity="deep work session",
    people_present=[],
    lighting="dim",
    music="ambient",
    focus_level="high",
    project="memory agent development",
    tools_used=["VSCode", "Redis", "OpenAI"]
)

agent.store_memory("Made significant progress on the API documentation")
```

### Memory Analysis
```python
# Get detailed memory information
info = agent.get_memory_info()
print(f"Total memories: {info['memory_count']}")
print(f"Vector dimension: {info['vector_dimension']}")

# Search with different similarity thresholds
memories = agent.search_memories("Tokyo food", top_k=10)
high_relevance = [m for m in memories if m['score'] > 0.8]
medium_relevance = [m for m in memories if 0.6 < m['score'] <= 0.8]
```

### Question Answering Strategies
```python
# Different question types
factual_response = agent.answer_question("What restaurants did I visit in Tokyo?")
opinion_response = agent.answer_question("What did I think of the Tokyo restaurants?")
comparison_response = agent.answer_question("How did Tokyo food compare to Paris food?")
recommendation_response = agent.answer_question("What Tokyo restaurants would you recommend?")
```

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to store memory: {e}")
```

## Context Types

### Temporal References
**Detected:** today, yesterday, now, this morning, last week, recently
**Resolved to:** Specific dates and times

```python
# Input: "I had a great meeting today"
# Output: "I had a great meeting on January 15, 2024"
```

### Spatial References
**Detected:** here, outside, this place, nearby, upstairs, local
**Resolved to:** Specific locations

```python
# Input: "It's really crowded here"
# Output: "Tokyo, Japan is really crowded"
```

### Personal References
**Detected:** this guy, my boss, the meeting, that person
**Resolved to:** Specific names when determinable

```python
# Input: "Sarah had great ideas in the meeting"
# Context: people_present=["Sarah", "Mike"]
# Output: "Sarah had great ideas in the team meeting"
```

### Environmental References
**Detected:** this weather, the current situation, right now
**Resolved to:** Specific conditions with location/time

```python
# Input: "This weather is terrible"
# Output: "The weather in Jakarta, Indonesia on January 15, 2024 is terrible"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Context Snapshots
Each grounded memory includes a context snapshot:

```python
memory = agent.search_memories("weather")[0]
context = memory["context_snapshot"]
print(context["temporal"]["date"])  # "Monday, January 15, 2024"
print(context["spatial"]["location"])  # "Jakarta, Indonesia"
```

### Grounding Information
View what changes were made during grounding:

```python
memory = agent.search_memories("hot")[0]
if memory["grounding_applied"]:
    changes = memory["grounding_info"]["changes_made"]
    for change in changes:
        print(f"{change['original']} → {change['replacement']} ({change['type']})")
```

### Batch Operations
```python
# Set context once
agent.set_context(location="Conference Center", activity="tech conference")

# Store multiple memories
memories = [
    "The keynote speaker was amazing",
    "This venue has great WiFi", 
    "I met some interesting people here"
]

for memory in memories:
    agent.store_memory(memory)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Set context before storing memories** for optimal grounding
2. **Use specific locations** ("Tokyo, Japan" vs "here")
3. **Update context when changing locations/activities**
4. **Include relevant people** in social context
5. **Review grounded memories** to ensure accuracy

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    agent = MemoryAgent()
    agent.store_memory("Test memory")
except redis.ConnectionError:
    print("Redis not available")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
